Hi, This is my code for the blackjack game so far. Initially I have managed to get the main functionality of the game itself working whilst also managing to do most of the main unit testing scenarios until I ran in to a lot of trouble with mockito and J unit. My research concluded lot of my troubles here was to do with me using JRE compiler instead of an JDK compiler and I did not have enough time to rectify this issue. Right now the tests are failing due to a null object thanks to this issue and I could not finish the rest of them.

If I had more time I planned on separating a lot of the code in the player class in to its own 'Hand class' as I believe there is too much logic in the player class that isn't necessarily attributed to the player. I would also have added in a lot more user interaction than I did as well as adding multiplayer functionality to the game instead of just the barebones logic of blackjack. 

Having not spent as much time as I'd have liked to due to contracting covid around the time the test was sent out as well as suffering a torn ligament in my knee. I believe I could have added a lot more to this assignment if it weren't due to my circumstances. I intend on improving on what I have done so far, maybe I will get to show the improved version at the next stage. 

Thanks,
Qasim
